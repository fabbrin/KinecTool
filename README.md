# KinecTool
A repository of open kinect projects


A repository of open kinect projects. KinecTool is the result of my work for the Human Computer Interaction course (University of Florence - Prof. A. D. Bagdanov)


*Hand gesture based Human-Computer-Interaction (HCI) is one of the most natural and intuitive ways to communicate between people and machines. Compared to the entire human body, the hand is a smaller object with more complex articulations and more easily affected by segmentation errors. It is thus a very challenging problem to recognize hand gestures. In this project, i use Candescent NUI libraries for hands and fingers tracking and i use Kinect SDK for hand gestures. In conclusion propose two demos: one for the game rock paper scissors (RPS) to demonstrate the performance of Candescent NUI libraries in a real life application and other for the control of PowerPoint or PDF program using Kinect SDK.*

### Prerequisities

- A Microsoft Kinect Controller - all projects are based on this device
- Candescent NUI Library - hand and fingers tracking library
- Microsoft Visual Studio - development environment (IDE) from Microsoft
- Kinect SDK - Microsoft skeleton tracking library
- OpenNI - SDK used for the development of 3D sensing middleware libraries and applications 

### Project structure

bin: contains binaries and instruction
UsabilityTest: contains the little website used for the timed test and the usability questionnaire
ClickGestureTrainer: sources of the training set recorder for the click gesture (left and right)
Controller: sources of the main application (AirMouse)
MergeTrainingSet sources of the training sets merger
StaticGesturesTrainer: sources of the training set recorder for the hand poses
